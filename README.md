## Walmart-future-sales-Predition
A retail store with multiple outlets across the country is experiencing significant challenges in managing its inventory. These issues are primarily related to accurately matching the demand for products with the available supply at each outlet. The misalignment between demand and supply has resulted in various operational inefficiencies, impacting both customer satisfaction and the store's profitability.

## Problem Object
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the retail chain's sales data to understand the underlying factors affecting weekly sales and to develop predictive models for forecasting future sales. Specifically, the project aims to address the following key questions:

Unemployment Rate Impact: Investigate if the weekly sales are influenced by the unemployment rate and identify which stores are most affected by changes in unemployment.

Seasonal Trends: Determine whether weekly sales exhibit a seasonal trend, identify the time periods of these trends, and understand the potential reasons behind these seasonal patterns.

Temperature Influence: Assess the effect of temperature on weekly sales and analyze if there is any significant relationship between temperature variations and sales performance.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) Effect: Examine how the Consumer Price Index affects weekly sales across different stores, and determine the extent of its impact.

Store Performance Analysis: Identify the top-performing stores based on historical sales data and evaluate the factors contributing to their success.

Worst Performing Store: Determine the worst performing store and analyze the significance of the difference between the highest and lowest performing stores.

Sales Forecasting: Utilize predictive modeling techniques to forecast the sales for each store for the next 12 weeks, providing actionable insights for inventory management and strategic planning.

By addressing these objectives, the project seeks to uncover the key drivers of sales performance, identify areas for improvement, and provide reliable sales forecasts to enhance the retail chain's inventory management and operational efficiency.
